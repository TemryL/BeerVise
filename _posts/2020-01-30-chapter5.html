<p>Here we are, after all these analysis, it's now time to show you how would your favourite supermarket beers' shelves look like. A new way of 
presenting the different products which we think can help lots of customers to make their choice when they are undecided and stuck in front of hundreds of 
different products. We really think that this will change lots of peoples' life and maybe yours as well. This is a win-win strategy for both you
as a customer and the supermarket as seller. Indeed, imporving the experience of the clients in the supermaket is a way to build up customer loyalty and that's exactly 
what we are lokking for. So, without further ado, you have been waiting for it to better understand the objective of our analysis, and now everything 
should be more clear...</p>

<p>Now you see it, you walk in your supermarket heading to the beers aisle and now you see this new arangement. Beers classified by category of consumer and style.
All you have to do is to identify yourself to a category. Do you consider yourself as a beer regular consumer or rather a complete beginner that is discovering this
beverage? Maybe none of them and you just want to try something new ? And what about trying the local beers those coming from the country you're living in? 
Well, with this new method of presenting the beers on the shelves, you will have suggestions of beers for eaach of these questions you can ask yourself. And to further 
help you as a client, for each style of beer presented on the shelves, you can read the most popular adjectives which people tend to use to describe the style of beer
you are facing. Indeed, what can be better to have a beer style description than having the insight directly from other customers just like you.</p>
